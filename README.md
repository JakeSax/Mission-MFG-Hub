# Mission MFG Hub
### A Manufacturing Job Scheduling System
I'm working on developing an app for Mission MFG that accomplishes a few things:
* Pulls incoming jobs in from ClickUp
* Organizes into steps all the measurements, photos, and programs needed to manufacture each item contained in the job
* Markup capabilities for photos taken to show how to set up jobs
* Able to add/edit headers and body text for each step
