# Mission MFG Hub
### A Manufacturing Job Scheduling System
I'm working on developing an app for Mission MFG, a company that mills and turns aluminum and steel parts, that accomplishes a few things:
* Synchronizes jobs with ClickUp
* Organizes into steps all the information, measurements, photos, and programs needed to manufacture each item contained in the job
* Markup capabilities for photos taken to show how to set up jobs
* Able to add/edit headers and body text for each step
* Capacity planning

### UI Prototype

You can see here on the left side we have a part title, with a step title and step arrows below that, along with some information for that step, i.e. What machine should be used? How long should this step take? What's the number for this program, if applicable? Below that you have a scrolling text section with pairs of headers and body text that the user can add, edit, and delete as they go. On the right it displays either photos corresponding to that step, or the print for that step (the document with all the technical drawings, tolerances, measurements, and specifications). Below the photo is an area with the part number, quantity ordered, customer name, and due date.
